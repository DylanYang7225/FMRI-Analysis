# Resting-state FMRI Time-series Analysis


This is a collaborative project with Dr. Andrew Michael. The goal is to explore the memory properties of resting human brain fMRI time-series in the dataset of 820 healthy young men. 
We adopt the classical time-series analytical tools which includes stationarity analysis, Hurst exponent, test-retest reliability analysis and ARIMA-GARCH modeling.
